# Fitness Tracker App

This Fitness Tracker App is designed to help you log and track your daily exercises using the Nutritionix API. It calculates the calories burned for various exercises based on your personal details such as gender, weight, height, and age.

Features

Personalized Exercise Tracking: Automatically calculates calories burned based on your personal characteristics and the specific exercises you perform.
Dynamic Input: Allows you to input any exercise you did in a natural language format.
Data Logging: Logs each exercise session with details including date, time, exercise name, duration, and calories burned.
How It Works

User Input: Start by inputting the exercise activity you did in a natural language format (e.g., "I ran 3 miles" or "30 minutes of yoga").
API Request: The app sends this information to the Nutritionix API, along with your personal details (gender, age, weight, height) to calculate the calories burned.
Logging: The app then logs this exercise data, including calories burned, to a separate database or sheet for tracking and analysis.
